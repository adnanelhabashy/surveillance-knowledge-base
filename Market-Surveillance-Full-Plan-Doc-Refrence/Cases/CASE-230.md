## SMARTS mapping

- **Public mapping:** Not mapped to an explicitly named Nasdaq SMARTS behavior from the public material used by the source catalog.
- Keep this as a surveillance requirement candidate rather than claiming SMARTS coverage.

## Implementation workspace

- **Rule status:** Initial contextual deterministic model
- **Detection mode:** Rules + account, fee, authorization and broker records; AI not required
- **Rule logic (starter):** Flag broker/customer-account conduct where executions, allocations, fees, account usage or crosses systematically transfer value, generate excessive compensation, avoid controls or occur without the required authorization/context.
- **Orleans grains/state:** AccountGrain, BrokerGrain, TraderGrain, TradeGrain, FeeGrain, PositionGrain, RelationshipGrain, SurveillanceGrain; preserve customer mandate, fee schedule, capacity and allocation history
- **Required event fields:** eventTime, account/customer/trader/broker IDs, order/trade IDs, instrumentId, side, price, quantity, capacity, authorization/mandate, commission/markup/markdown/fee, market reference price, allocation/error-account/cancel-rebill fields, related personal/proprietary account
- **Time window(s):** Per trade; daily account activity; rolling 30/90-day turnover, fee and transfer patterns
- **Thresholds/calibration:** Hard alert for missing authorization or prohibited account relationship where configured. Behavioral starter: turnover/fee ratio > 99th percentile, price disadvantage > 2–5× normal spread, repeated value transfer ≥ 3 events, or commissions/fees materially disproportionate to account size/activity.
- **Alert evidence:** Customer mandate/authorization; execution and reference price; fee calculation; account turnover; allocation/cancel-rebill history; related proprietary/personal account; quantified value transfer/customer harm
- **Implementation note:** Starter engineering model only. Calibrate by instrument liquidity, session phase, participant type and historical percentiles before production use.
