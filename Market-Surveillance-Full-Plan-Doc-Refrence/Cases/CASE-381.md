## SMARTS mapping

- **Public mapping:** This is a narrower variant of a behavior Nasdaq publicly describes SMARTS as monitoring.
- Nasdaq does not publish the full proprietary alert library, so this note does not claim a one-to-one SMARTS alert.

## Implementation workspace

- **Rule status:** Initial deterministic model
- **Detection mode:** Rules; AI not required
- **Rule logic (starter):** Flag trading concentrated inside a benchmark/reference calculation window when the participant contributes disproportionate volume or directional price impact and has an economic exposure that benefits from moving the benchmark.
- **Orleans grains/state:** BenchmarkGrain, OrderBookGrain, TradeGrain, PositionGrain, TraderGrain, InstrumentGrain, SurveillanceGrain; retain benchmark constituents, calculation windows, participant contribution and before/after prices
- **Required event fields:** eventTime, tradeId/orderId, traderId, accountId, instrumentId, price, quantity, side, benchmarkId, benchmarkWindowStart/End, benchmarkValue/referencePrice, constituentWeight, position/exposure, venueId
- **Time window(s):** Exact benchmark calculation window plus 5–30 min before/after; daily historical baseline; position horizon through settlement if applicable
- **Thresholds/calibration:** Start with participant ≥ 20% of window volume or top 1% historical participation, directional impact ≥ 3 ticks/0.5%, concentration in final 20% of window, and demonstrable exposure benefit. Calibrate separately for VWAP/TWAP/settlement/NAV/reference-price cases.
- **Alert evidence:** Benchmark formula/window; participant trades; contribution to volume/value; counterfactual benchmark excluding participant; exposure/P&L benefit; pre/post-window reversion
- **Implementation note:** Starter engineering model only. Calibrate by instrument liquidity, session phase, participant type and historical percentiles before production use.
