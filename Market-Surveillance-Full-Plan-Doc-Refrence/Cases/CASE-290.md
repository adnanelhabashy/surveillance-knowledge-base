## SMARTS mapping

- **Public mapping:** Not mapped to an explicitly named Nasdaq SMARTS behavior from the public material used by the source catalog.
- Keep this as a surveillance requirement candidate rather than claiming SMARTS coverage.

## Implementation workspace

- **Rule status:** Initial contextual deterministic model
- **Detection mode:** Rules + securities-lending data; AI not required
- **Rule logic (starter):** Flag securities-lending transactions with inconsistent ownership, collateral, quantity/rate reporting, unusual related-party economics, sham finder fees/kickbacks, or unexplained changes designed to facilitate another trading abuse.
- **Orleans grains/state:** SecuritiesLoanGrain, AccountGrain, InvestorGrain, RelationshipGrain, PositionGrain, SettlementGrain, SurveillanceGrain; track loan lifecycle, collateral, rates, beneficial owner and intermediaries
- **Required event fields:** loanId, eventTime, lender/borrower/account IDs, beneficialOwnerId, instrumentId, quantity, rate/fee/rebate, collateralType/value, start/end/modify times, finder/intermediary IDs/fees, settlement status
- **Time window(s):** Loan lifecycle; intraday change window; daily collateral/rate checks; 5–30 day repeated counterparty/economic pattern
- **Thresholds/calibration:** Hard checks for reported-vs-actual quantity/rate mismatch or collateral below required policy. Statistical alerts: rate/fee > 99th percentile, finder fee without service evidence, repeated same counterparties, collateral deficit > configured tolerance.
- **Alert evidence:** Loan agreement/lifecycle; reported vs actual fields; collateral calculation; fee flows; related-party graph; linked short/settlement activity; modification history
- **Implementation note:** Starter engineering model only. Calibrate by instrument liquidity, session phase, participant type and historical percentiles before production use.
