## SMARTS mapping

- **Public mapping:** Not mapped to an explicitly named Nasdaq SMARTS behavior from the public material used by the source catalog.
- Keep this as a surveillance requirement candidate rather than claiming SMARTS coverage.

## Implementation workspace

- **Rule status:** Initial deterministic model
- **Detection mode:** Rules; AI not required
- **Rule logic (starter):** Flag participant activity concentrated in opening/closing or auction windows when it has disproportionate impact on indicative/final price or imbalance, especially if large orders are cancelled late, positions benefit from the result, or the move reverses after the reference point is set.
- **Orleans grains/state:** AuctionGrain, OrderBookGrain, TraderGrain, AccountGrain, PositionGrain, InstrumentGrain, SurveillanceGrain; store indicative price/volume/imbalance series and participant auction contributions
- **Required event fields:** eventTime, sessionPhase, auctionId, orderId, traderId, accountId, instrumentId, side, price, quantity, action, indicativePrice, indicativeVolume, imbalanceQty/side, finalAuctionPrice, referencePrice, executions, position/exposure if available
- **Time window(s):** Entire auction; last 60 s and last 10 s before uncross; final 5–10 min for close-marking; first 5–10 min for open-marking; next-session reversion check
- **Thresholds/calibration:** Start with participant contribution ≥ 20% of auction imbalance/volume, indicative/final impact ≥ 3 ticks or 0.5%, late cancellation ≥ 25% of displayed auction quantity, and/or reversal ≥ 50% of induced move. Use instrument-specific percentiles.
- **Alert evidence:** Indicative-price timeline; imbalance timeline; participant orders/cancels; final uncross executions; price impact attribution; position benefit; post-auction/next-session reversion
- **Implementation note:** Starter engineering model only. Calibrate by instrument liquidity, session phase, participant type and historical percentiles before production use.
