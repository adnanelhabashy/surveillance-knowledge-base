# 299. Moving-Wall Manipulation

## Description

Moving a large deceptive bid or offer wall with the market so the apparent support or resistance follows the price.

## SMARTS mapping

- **Public mapping:** Not mapped to an explicitly named Nasdaq SMARTS behavior from the public material used by the source catalog.
- Keep this as a surveillance requirement candidate rather than claiming SMARTS coverage.

## Implementation workspace

- **Rule status:** Initial deterministic model
- **Detection mode:** Rules; AI not required
- **Rule logic (starter):** Flag when a participant displays unusually large non-bona-fide-looking interest, cancels most of it quickly after influencing book/price, and either trades on the opposite side or gains an execution advantage. For layering, also require multiple price levels or repeated waves.
- **Orleans grains/state:** OrderBookGrain, TraderGrain, AccountGrain, InstrumentGrain, SurveillanceGrain; keep live depth, per-order lifecycle, participant cancellation/execution stats and opposite-side fills
- **Required event fields:** eventId, eventTime, orderId, parentOrderId/algorithmId if available, traderId, accountId, beneficialOwnerId if available, instrumentId, venueId, side, orderType, price, quantity, displayedQuantity, action(new/modify/cancel), executionQty, executionPrice, bestBid/bestAsk, depthByLevel
- **Time window(s):** Primary 1–5 s order-lifecycle window; rolling 30–60 s participant/instrument window; 5–15 min repetition window
- **Thresholds/calibration:** Start with displayed size ≥ 5× instrument median, cancellation ratio ≥ 80%, lifetime ≤ 3 s, price/book impact ≥ 1 tick, opposite-side execution within 10 s; layering: ≥ 3 price levels. Replace with liquidity-bucket percentiles during calibration.
- **Alert evidence:** Full order lifecycle; before/after order-book snapshots; cancelled quantity; price/depth impact; opposite-side executions; participant metrics; repeated similar episodes; related-account links if relevant
- **Implementation note:** Starter engineering model only. Calibrate by instrument liquidity, session phase, participant type and historical percentiles before production use.
