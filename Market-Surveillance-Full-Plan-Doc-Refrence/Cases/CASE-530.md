## SMARTS mapping

- **Public mapping:** Not mapped to an explicitly named Nasdaq SMARTS behavior from the public material used by the source catalog.
- Keep this as a surveillance requirement candidate rather than claiming SMARTS coverage.

## Implementation workspace

- **Rule status:** Initial deterministic model
- **Detection mode:** Rules; AI not required
- **Rule logic (starter):** Flag coordinated activity across economically related instruments when orders/trades in one product materially influence another and the participant holds a position that benefits from the induced move, especially near expiry, strike, barrier or index/ETF calculation events.
- **Orleans grains/state:** InstrumentGrain, OrderBookGrain per product, PositionGrain, TraderGrain, RelationshipGrain, BenchmarkGrain where applicable, SurveillanceGrain; maintain product-link graph and synchronized event windows
- **Required event fields:** eventTime, traderId, accountId, beneficialOwnerId, instrumentId, relatedInstrumentId, productType, underlyingId, side, price, quantity, order/trade action, delta/exposure if available, expiry/strike/barrier, indexWeight/ETF relationship, venueId
- **Time window(s):** 100 ms–60 s synchronized trading window; 5–30 min manipulation episode; expiry/settlement event window; daily exposure context
- **Thresholds/calibration:** Start with cross-product correlation/sequence within ≤ 5 s, manipulated-leg participation ≥ 10–20%, price impact ≥ 2–3 ticks, and positive economic benefit in related position. For pinning/barriers require proximity within 0.25–0.5% of trigger/reference.
- **Alert evidence:** Linked instruments; synchronized timelines; order-book impact on manipulated leg; related position/exposure; estimated economic benefit; expiry/strike/barrier/reference context
- **Implementation note:** Starter engineering model only. Calibrate by instrument liquidity, session phase, participant type and historical percentiles before production use.
